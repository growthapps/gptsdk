With GptSdk, we can overcome problems with AI management and focus on the growth of our application. Make AI the ‚Äòdetail‚Äô of your application, not the ‚Äòbusiness rule.‚Äô GptSdk allows software development teams to take AI feature development to a new level.

Use this library to add AI to your Laravel/Symfony application.
Use [GptSdk](https://gpt-sdk.com?via=github) to overcome prompt management problems.

## üì≤ Installation

Install this package as a dependency using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

``` bash
composer require growthapps/gptsdk
```


## üé¢ Usage
You can use this library without GptSdk account.
Just install this package into your laravel/symfony application and enjoy openai integration.
``` php
$promptLocalRunner = new PromptLocalRunner(
    new PromptCompiler(),
    new ArrayCollection([
        VendorEnum::OPENAI->value => new OpenAiVendor(
            HttpClient::create()
        )
    ],
    new PromptRunLogger()
);

$promptRun = $promptLocalRunner->run(
    new PromptRun(
        vendorKey: VendorEnum::OPENAI,
        promptMessages: new ArrayCollection(
            [
                new PromptMessage(
                    role: 'User',
                    content: 'Hello gpt! How are you? Reply in [[tone]] tone.'
                )
            ]
        ),
        promptKey: 'hello_prompt',
        params: new ArrayCollection(
            [
                new PromptParam(
                    type: Type::STRING,
                    key: 'tone',
                    value: 'angry'
                )
            ]
        ),
    )
);
```

If you already created GptSdk account you can use `GptSdkApiClient`:
- create prompt in the GptSdk (https://gpt-sdk.com?via=github)
- set prompt key under API section on the right
- copy prompt key, api key and use `GptSdkApiClient` to send prompt in your code:
```php
$gptSdkClient = new GptSdkApiClient(
    HttpClient::create(),
    'myapikey'
);
$promptRun = $gptSdkClient->runPrompt(
    new PromptRun(
        promptKey: 'hello_prompt',
        params: new ArrayCollection(
            [
                new PromptParam(
                    type: Type::STRING,
                    key: 'tone',
                    value: 'angry'
                )
            ]
        ),
    )
);

echo $promptRun->getResponse();
```
